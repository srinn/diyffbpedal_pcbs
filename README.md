# DIY FFB Pedal PCBs to make a little bit small
This project is a derivative project of this: https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal

I modified the layout a little bit to make the PCB a little smaller for this DIY project. The circuit design wasn't all done by me. Please respect what they have done üòò

## Power PCB:

You can order this PCB from any PCB Makers using this Gerber file. ex) PCBWay, JLCPCB, ...

You can download Gerber file here: [Download Power PCB Gerber file](https://github.com/srinn/diyffbpedal_pcbs/raw/main/power_pcb_different_batch_by_srin/Gerber_Power-Pcb-With-100v-3300uf_PCB_Power-Pcb-With-100v-3300uf_2024-05-04.zip)
