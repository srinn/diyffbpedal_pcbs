# DIY FFB Pedal PCBs to make a little bit small
This project is a derivative project of this: https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal

I made some modifications to the layout to make the PCB of this DIY project a little smaller. I didn't do all the circuit design. I just made some modifications. Please respect what they have done üòò

## Power PCB:

You can order this PCB from any PCB Makers using this Gerber file. ex) PCBWay, JLCPCB, ...

You can download Gerber file here: [Download Power PCB Gerber file](https://github.com/srinn/diyffbpedal_pcbs/raw/main/power_pcb_different_batch_by_srin/Gerber_Power-Pcb-With-100v-3300uf_PCB_Power-Pcb-With-100v-3300uf_2024-05-04.zip)

If you want to batch your 3D CAD project, use this step file: [Download Power PCB step file](https://github.com/srinn/diyffbpedal_pcbs/raw/main/power_pcb_different_batch_by_srin/3D_PCB_Power%20Pcb%20With%20100v%203300uf_2024-04-23%20v1.step)

## FFB Pedal PCB:

Be careful, ESP32 must have to be placed like this:

Have Fun! üòÅ
