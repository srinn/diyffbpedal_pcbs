# DIY FFB Pedal PCBs to make a little bit small
This project is a derivative project of this: https://github.com/ChrGri/DIY-Sim-Racing-FFB-Pedal

I modified the layout a little bit to make the PCB a little smaller for this DIY project. The circuit design wasn't all done by me. Please respect what they have done ðŸ˜˜
